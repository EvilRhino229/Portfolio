  <h4>As you're already able to tell, my name's Tim Kepple, and I'm a software engineering student located in western Illinois.</h4>
  <h5>Some of my hobbies include music, video games, and foreign languages. 환영합니다, 리더, 만나서 반갑습니다!</h5>
  <p>As a child, one of my favorite things to do was to build LEGO sets, the idea of being able to build anything within the constraints of what I owned at the time was fascinating to me. As a result, the older I got, I came to view programming the same way, and with a gentle push from one Jamie Gladfelter in Galesburg, Illinois, I took my first official step into formal education in web development and computer programming.</p>
  <p>After completing the Main Street Codes 2019 web development course they offered, I was contacted in December regarding a partnership with Kenzie Academy, an organization I had at this point never heard of. The informational session, in which I was the only attendee, was enlightening, and within a couple weeks I was enrolled in their January 2020 Software Engineering cohort.</p>
  <p>Ups and downs were had, of course, and after mitigating circumstances led to a decrease in performance I had no choice but to defer the second quarter and switch to the April group instead. This was only a temporary setback though, and I ended up passing the second time around with a considerably better support system and a grade to reflect that. All in all, the experience led me here, where at the time of writing I'm currently about three weeks away from graduation.</p>
  <p>Over the course of the past year, I've trained in React, Node + Express, MongoDB, Python, and Django. The intensive coursework has helped me gain an understanding of each of the tools and frameworks we used throughout the program, and it even led me to use Node and Express to create my own API, where one day I hope to be able to hook up to a React or Rails app. Another thing I hope to expand is this site, which I built out to be as interactive as possible in hopes that I can keep using it with little maintenance and no need to change anything hardcoded directly into the project. In addition, I have a burning desire to complete the minimum viable product for my 2019 capstone, an interactive guitar tuner I've been developing that uses premade Ruby gems to compare a live-recorded audio sample with a "correctly-tuned" one.</p>
  <p>Thanks for reading this far, I hope to use this page in the future as an interactive place to store my coding experience, but also as an opportunity to showcase some of my technical skill in making the app itself. Rather than traditional means such as a premade blog where I put up pictures or a wordy cover letter that I use to reiterate some of my experience, I'm hoping I'll be able to add complex and scalable enough functionality to my portfolio app that it alone can speak as a testament to my ability more than just a resume.</p>
